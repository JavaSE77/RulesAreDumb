# RulesAreDumb
Simple rules plugin created for my minecraft server. Allows players to see the rules and accept them. Informs players when rules have updated
You are free to use this plugin, and my code, or none of it at all. Written for paper spigot 1.5.2. I have no plans to publish
this on spigot, but if you find it on github, I hope you enjoy it. 
(Please hire me)
